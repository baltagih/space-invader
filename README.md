# space-invader
## The project
Since I am getting into machine learning, I built this very basic space invader game (that still needs some tweaks) to try
and implement reinforcement learning into it.  
This project is to be continued and completed soon.  
The plan is to let the game play itself and give it a reward when it kills monsters (or when the score gets bigger) and 
"punish" it when it loses the game.  
This way, the game will learn to play itself and become better and better at the game after every iteration.  
I am thinking of using TensorflowJs for this project.  
I built this using p5.js and p5.collide2D.  
If you are reading this and would recommend a different framework, let me know.
